## Overview
Challenge started Monday 14-11 before courses.
As I am currently taking PHP courses, I wanted to keep using Javascript in my free time because it has been pretty difficult to me at the beginning and I don't want to lose everything I got then.
The time showing is the delay I have to find and start a training period in a company as a developper.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page : 

This was the easy part as there are only 3 social medias icons in the bottom. Generally speaking about the static part of the project, the trickier part for me was to design the cards with their concave rounded edges in the middle of the cards. I have to go back a litlle bit on the responsive as it's still ugly at certain widths. But the hardest part wasn't there yet...

- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days) : 

Pretty easy with JS. I certainly will factorize the code relating to time later as it is a little too heavy in ressources at the moment. The time displayed is the delay I have to find and start a training period in a company as a developper ^^'

- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle : 

THIS was HELL (still is actually) as I want it to be realistic and having the halves of cards falling from the top while bending in the middle. I had to play with setInterval and transform transition in CSS. This is currently (11/16/2022) still a work in progress, the 'seconds' part almost working but... only on Google Chrome, so I'll have to do some research about css comptatibility with Mozilla Firefox (the other navigator I tested) and others.

### Screenshot

// TODO when finished
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I'm a newbie and as such I'm not really well organized, though I began with the static front and everything around the cards, then the cards. 

Once the design was mainly OK, I moved to JS to animate the cards.
The simple version on Netlify is OK.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS for interactivity
- to be continued...

### What I learned

I definitely understood 'position: relative' and 'position: absolute' in CSS which were not that clear in my mind.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
